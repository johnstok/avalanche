Alternative workloads (See httperf, --period argument)
 - exponential (poisson) (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/753802/27929)
 - continuous uniform, i.e. all intervals of the same length on the distribution's support are equally probable â€“ over the interval [T1,T2) (see Random#nextDouble())
 - gaussian interval (see Random#nextGaussian())
 - Pareto

N.B. the above can be both open and closed

Also, we should provide a way to compose workloads. I.e.
 - 200 requests @ 1 req / sec _then_
 - 400 requests @ 2 req / sec _then_
 - 800 requests @ 4 req / sec _then_
 - etc.
